    <h3>Some of the storys about my hobbies</h3>
    <p>One time i was out riding my dirtbike in walker valley and me and my uncle went down one last trail before we went home. when we got to the end of the trail we decided to race back to the truck, im faster on the road and he was faster on the trail so we raced back and i won but not befor i wrected my bike. i had to make a decition between hiting a $30,000 and hitting a %100 trailer because i got stuck between a narrow path my bike didn't fit in.</p>
    <p>I went Go-Karting once and i won angints everybody there.</p>
    <p>i hung out friends almost evrey day in the summer we were almost always at the Davies Beach in Lake Stevens from 11:00 AM to 9:00 PM or just walking aroud town.</p>
